* ICONTAINS and IOVERLAPS commands add COUNT argument
** ICONTAINS <key> <valueToSearch> [COUNT <amount>]. The count argument tells the command to return only the first `amount` intervals to return. That transform the command complexity from O(log(N) + M) to O(log(M) + O(1)) = O(log(N))
** IOVERLAPS : same as previous command
* ICONTAINS and IOVERLAPS commands add multiple arguments ?
* ICONTAINS and IOVERLAPS add store option
** ICONTAINS <key> <valueToSearch> [STORE <destination>]
** IOVERLAPS same as previous command
